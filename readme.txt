A plugin to Maintainn your WordPress website

== Description ==

For years, <a href="https://maintainn.com/">Maintainn</a> has helped thousands of clients keep their websites updated and secured. During that time, we’ve built a number of tools to help us do just that. With the Maintainn Tools plugin, we’re making a number of those tools available to you!

<strong>Site Info:</strong> See a top level view of your entire WordPress install. View registered post types and post statuses, permalink structure, multisite network active plugins, active and inactive plugins, must-use plugins (MU), site and server details, browser details, session details, and email yourself a copy.

<strong>Site Scanner:</strong> Compare the WordPress Core files on your website hosting server to the current WordPress files available from the WordPress.org repository to ensure they have not been altered in any way.

<strong>Manage Plugins:</strong>Turn on/off automatic updates for specific plugins. Or, lock specific plugins from being updated.

<strong>Plugin Admin Notes:</strong> Add notes next to each plugin.
